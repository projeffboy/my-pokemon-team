DO THESE THINGS
0. Preliminary easy stuff
  -change default paper
  -but then bullet seed is deemed a lower power move
1. Finish the Pokmon Showdown import, download, and copy.
  -Pokemon Showdown Team
    -import team
    -export team
    -get the right icons
2. Make format filters display the most relevant pokemon first
3. Add icons to pokemon and item select.
4. Add tooltips to type defence, coverage, and checklist.
5. Add type chart.
6. Stylize the site.
  -color scheme
  -change color of meta theme color
  -have a look at manifest
  -change favicon
  -make placeholder text different color than selected text
  -stylize react-virtualized-select
7. Check for responsiveness (and test touch on mobile).
  -repsonsiveness for widescreens
8. Speed up the page somehow.
  -with 6 pokemon cards, it seems like code is launched 6 times for each pokmeon card
  -functions that call in the beginning even though they shouldn't be
  -deal with import crisis: react-loadable?
9. Deploy

STYLE CHANGES
-the input delete x button too big

FUTURE
-no repeated moves
-moves that are incompatible together
-host images yourself?
-update about pages
-porygonZ

-smogon tiers provide restrictions for abilities, etc., not just pokemon
-dark theme

-change search filters so that maybe tiers only show pokemon of that tier (or show those first)?

Minor stuff
-weird stuff with like arceus-normal with draco plate has normal type judgement
-or silvally-normal with dark memory has normal-type multi-attack
