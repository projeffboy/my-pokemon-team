### The Ultimate Pokemon Teambuilder at mypokemonteam.com

## What makes this teambuilder special?
1. You can import/export your team to Pokemon Showdown
2. It's very accurate, it takes into account special abilities (Levitate, Thick Fat, Filter, Sap Sipper, Aerilate, Wonder Guard, etc.) and moves (Freeze Dry, Flying Press, Seismic Toss, Judgment, etc.)
3. There's a team checklist.
4. The sprites are animated, which is nice

## Hiatus
I have midterms and finals all the way to April :/

## Features to Work on
In the summer, I plan on implementing these 3 things first:
1. Setting EV, IV, and natures
2. Using your base speed, EV, and IV to determine your speed tier
3. Polishing the design of the site

I'll be sure to update the site for Pokemon Sword and Shield when it comes out (as soon as Showdown has the data for it!)

You can check out the issues tab to see what other improvements I have in mind. Or you can create a new issue if you have suggestions of your own :)

If you want to help me write code for new features, I would suggest that you save your time, because my code is messy and getting borderline unmaintainable. I'll have to redesign it from the inside first.
