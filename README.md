### The Ultimate Pokemon Teambuilder!

## Hiatus
I have midterms and finals all the way to April :/

## Features to Work on
In the summer, I plan on implementing these 3 things first:
1. Setting EV, IV, and natures
2. Using your base speed, EV, and IV to determine your speed tier
3. Polishing the design of the site

I'll be sure to update the site for Pokemon Sword and Shield when it comes out (as soon as Showdown has the data for it!)

You can check out the issues tab to see what other improvements I have in mind. Or you can create a new issue if you have suggestions of your own :)
