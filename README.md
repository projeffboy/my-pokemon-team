### The Ultimate Pokemon Teambuilder at [mypokemonteam.com](https://mypokemonteam.com)
#### The site is finally updated for generation 8... It took me 10 hours. Had I known it would be that quick, I would have updated it 2 years ago...

## What makes this teambuilder special?
1. You can import/export your team to Pokemon Showdown
2. It's very accurate, it takes into account special abilities (Levitate, Thick Fat, Filter, Sap Sipper, Aerilate, Wonder Guard, etc.) and moves (Freeze Dry, Flying Press, Seismic Toss, Judgment, etc.)
3. There's a team checklist.
4. The sprites are animated, which is nice

## Features to Work on
1. Fix bugs, especially gen 8 related.
2. Rewrite bad code.

You can check out the issues tab to see what other improvements I have in mind. Or you can create a new issue if you have suggestions of your own :)

If you want to help me write code for new features, I would suggest that you save your time, because my code is messy and getting borderline unmaintainable. I'll have to rewrite all the bad code first.
