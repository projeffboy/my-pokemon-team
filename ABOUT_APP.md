This is a one-page app, there doesn't need to be routing.

We used create-react-app.

Uses React.
Uses MobX, not Redux.

/src folder contains all the source code.
tsconfig.json disables decorator warnings (decorates are needed for MobX).

All the dasta about pokemon, the abilities, items, etc. are store in the /src/data folder.

We use ES6:
-const (default) and let, never var
-destructuring
-template strings
-dynamic imports
